        "response": "Overfitting occurs when a model fits noise in the training data and fails to generalize. It uses too many parameters relative to samples, such as deep networks on small datasets. Underfitting, on the other hand, captures only the bias\u2013variance tradeoff; simple models on large datasets can also perform poorly if the underlying function is complex. Good ML practice aims to balance bias and variance, control capacity, and use techniques like data augmentation, regularization, and better initializations to reduce the risk of overfitting while capturing the underlying pattern.",

The goal is to learn a function that maps x to y and generalizes well to unseen data. Common tasks include regression and classification. Unsupervised learning deals with datasets without explicit labels. The goal is to discover structure in the data, such as clusters, low-dimensional manifolds, or latent variables. Examples include k-means clustering and PCA. Despite the name, unsupervised learning is important for understanding data distribution and organizing it for downstream tasks. In practice, unsupervised methods are often followed by",

        "response": "Activation functions introduce nonlinearity into neural networks. Common choices include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Without nonlinear activations, a deep network collapses to an effective linear model, limiting its expressiveness. With nonlinear activations, the network can represent more complex functions, enabling it to learn deeper and representational power. Typical choices include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, but others like Leaky ReLU, Swish, and Gelu are also used in practice. Good initialization, a suitable architecture, and a large enough dataset are also crucial for achieving low error and high interpretability.",

They learn hierarchical feature representations, from edges and textures to objects. CNNs typically include auxiliary heads for tasks such as segmentation or classification. By reusing the same weights across spatial locations, CNNs reduce the amount of training data needed and improve translation invariance compared to fully connected networks.",

They share parameters across timesteps and can model temporal dependencies in data such as text or time series. RNNs can be simple vanilla RNNs or more complex architectures like LSTM networks, which introduce additional mechanisms like gating mechanisms and reset buttons to control the flow of information. Despite their simplicity, RNNs are surprisingly powerful and can learn long-range dependencies in data, making them useful for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and predicting stock prices.",

        "response": "A feature store is a system that standardizes data inference into small, reusable functions called features. These features can then be easily composed together to train complex models or infer answers to business questions. By decoupling offline feature groups from online serving, the feature store reduces train\u2013serve skew and makes it easier to update features without changing the deployed pipeline. Features can be grouped by domain, product, or business capability, and they can be exposed via an API or integrated directly into ML monitoring systems. By standardizing how features are defined, obtained, and consumed, the feature store improves data quality, reduces data leakage, and simplifies ML engineering",

        "response": "Train-serve skew is the mismatch between training-time and serving-time data or feature computation. It leads to degraded performance in production when the model sees different distributions or feature logic than during training. Preventing train-serve skew is crucial for achieving low latency and high reliability in online serving systems. Techniques include monitoring feature stores for data drift, online feature groups for feature scheduling, and retry mechanisms or fallbacks for handling service failures. By understanding train-serve skew and applying these strategies, you can ensure that your model sees a consistent view of the data and environment during training and inference.",

By analyzing the results of these small experiments, we can identify which directions to prioritize next and reduce the risk of wasting time on unimportant hypotheses in the future. This approach makes data-centric iteration more efficient and helps avoid getting locked into an expensive experiment that may not lead to significant improvements.",

Regularly retraining or reconfiguring the model, updating feature engineering, and refining the monitoring pipeline are common ways to keep the system performing well over time.",
